## ðŸ“Š **Prosper Loan Data Visualization**  
### **About**  
Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that bridges borrowers with lenders, facilitating loans with transparency and efficiency. This project explores the Prosper dataset, leveraging Tableau to analyze and visualize key patterns and trends.  

### **Summary**  
This project delves into the relationships between the primary stakeholders in peer-to-peer lendingâ€”borrowers, lenders, and the Prosper platform. Key areas of analysis include:  
1. **Loan Trends (2007â€“2014):**  
   - Identified a significant increase in loan volumes post-2009, peaking in 2013 before tapering off in 2014.  
   - Observed a decline in borrower credit scores over the same period, with some states reporting default rates exceeding **30%**.  

2. **Defaulters Analysis:**  
   - Borrowers with **$0 income** exhibited the highest default rates, with loan type **â€˜Dâ€™** being a significant contributor.  
   - College students, particularly sophomores, had a unique pattern of lower loan counts but higher default rates.  

3. **Loan Ratings and Risk:**  
   - Loans with **â€˜HRâ€™ ratings**, while issued to credit-worthy borrowers, had the highest losses.  
   - **C&D rated loans** emerged as the riskiest, with the greatest losses in net principal returns over time.
